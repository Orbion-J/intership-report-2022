\begin{abstract}
  This paper is the report of my internship at the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh with Sam Lindley and Daniel Hillerström from 2 May 2022 to 22 July 2022.

  Effect handlers are a language feature that is becoming more and more widespread. They allow the user to define and compose many functionalities from exceptions to concurrency and probabilistic programming.

  Links is an experimental tierless functional language for the web, mainly developed in the University of Edinburgh. Among its numerous features, Links supports effect handlers.

  The goal of my intership was to improve the effect typing system of Links, allowing aliases, avoiding pollution and allowing polymorphic operations.
